# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    q1: <h4>What is this website?</h4>It's an image generator for top cut teams, a player database and a tournament stats calculator!
    q2: <h4>A tournament I played is not here</h4>We are humans and as we try to get as many tournaments results, it's very difficult to have them all.
    q3: <h4>How can I upload a tournament?</h4>If you are a TO or collaborator with access to top cuts teams, send us a private message to our <a href='https://www.facebook.com/vgcsets/'>facebook fanpage</a> asking for an uploader account, the only requirement we ask is that you upload future tournaments to the website.
